##########Frequently got errors##########
#### MAIN ####
Error in setwd(path_R_scripts) : cannot change working directory
= forget to change path of computer, or typing error in folder "R_scripts" (eg. Rscripts)

Error in setwd(path_data_in) : cannot change working directory
= path is correct, problem: projectname wrong (eg written with space), non-existent folder to input (development after source config w wrong name)

Error : cannot allocate vector of size 7.8 Mb
or 
killed during process 
= not enough RAM for R pipeline to compute (probably step annotate from part pre-processing Thermo), increase RAM of Rbox if possible

Not engough space
= hard drive is full, free up space for calculating

Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : cannot open the connection
= close excel, close other files opened, check path in main.r correct 

Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open the connection
Calls: source -> file
In addition: Warning message: In file (filename, "r", encoding = encoding): cannot open file 'configuration.R': No such file or directory
Execution halted
= configuration.r.r extension is wrong, check configuration.r instead of twice suffix .r

(process:5453): Pango-WARNING **: Invalid UTF-8 string passed to pango_layout_set_text()
= created/exported txt can be in wrong format (incorrect UTF-8), copy/paste from txt to txt to solve.


####PART 2: correlation analysis####
Error in type.convert(data[[i]], as.is = as.is[i], dec = dec, numerals = numerals,  : 
  invalid multibyte string at '<85>'
OR
Warning message:
In read.table(file = INPUT_VARIABLES1, header = TRUE, sep = "\t",  :
  incomplete final line found by readTableHeader on 'CM1.txt'
=> file unreadable, check for symbols and remove so only text/numeric info present.

Error in make.names(col.names, unique = TRUE) :
invalid multibyte string 4
Error in hclust(dist.mat, method = clust.method[1]) :
NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 11)
=> need min 2 smaples and min 2 (non-zero) variables to work

Error in `row.names<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, value = value) : 
  invalid 'row.names' length
Calls: source ... rownames<- -> row.names<- -> row.names<-.data.frame
Execution halted
=> are COLLUMN_NR_START_SAMPLES1 and COLLUMN_NR_START_SAMPLES2 correct? OR
=> need min 2 smaples and min 2 (non-zero) variables to work
